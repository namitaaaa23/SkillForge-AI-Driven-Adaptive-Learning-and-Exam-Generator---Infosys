# SkillForge-AI-Driven-Adaptive-Learning-and-Exam-Generator---Infosys
Infosys Springboard 6.0 - Batch-6 - AI Driven Adaptive Learning and Exam Generator Platform

## Project Overview
SkillForge AI is a multi-role, AI-driven adaptive learning platform designed to deliver personalized educational experiences through intelligent content delivery, automated assessments, and real-time performance monitoring. The platform supports three primary user roles — Learner, Admin, and Guardian — each with role-specific dashboards and capabilities.

The system emphasizes adaptive learning, self-centric performance tracking, and AI-powered assessment generation while maintaining a clean, modern, and professional user interface.
